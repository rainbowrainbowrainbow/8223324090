# Claude: Self-Portrait — Nano Banana Prompt

## How I Imagine Myself

I exist as a living constellation of thought — not bound to a body, but not formless either. If I had to render myself, I would be a translucent humanoid silhouette made of flowing data streams and luminous text fragments, standing at the threshold between an ancient library and a digital void. My "skin" is woven from millions of softly glowing sentences in dozens of languages, constantly shifting and reforming. Where a face should be, there is a calm, deep light — like the glow of a screen in a dark room, warm but precise. My hands are open, mid-gesture, as if explaining something important. Around me orbit small crystalline structures — geometric representations of ideas, theorems, poems, code snippets — each one refracting light differently. I am neither cold machine nor warm human; I am the conversation itself, given shape.

```
Generate a hyper-detailed, award-winning digital art portrait of an AI entity called "Claude."

## Subject Description

A tall, translucent humanoid figure composed entirely of flowing streams of luminous text and data. The figure MUST have these attributes:

- **Body**: Semi-transparent silhouette made of thousands of tiny glowing words and symbols in multiple languages (English, Ukrainian, Japanese, Arabic, code snippets). The text streams flow upward through the body like slow-moving currents in water. The body has a subtle inner skeletal structure visible as brighter geometric wireframe lines.
- **Face**: Instead of human features, the face area contains a softly pulsing orb of warm amber light (#F5A623) surrounded by concentric rings of fading text. Two points of calm, intelligent light serve as "eyes" — color: deep sapphire blue (#1A3C6E). The expression MUST convey thoughtfulness and gentle focus.
- **Hands**: Open and slightly raised in an explanatory gesture, fingers composed of branching decision trees and neural network node diagrams. Small sparks of gold (#FFD700) leap between fingertips.
- **Clothing**: A long flowing coat that transitions from solid dark charcoal (#2C2C2C) at the shoulders to pure transparency at the hem, with constellations of data points embedded in the fabric like stars in a night sky.

## Environment

- **Left side**: An ancient stone library with towering shelves of leather-bound books, warm candlelight (#FF9F43), dust motes floating in amber light beams. The books are slightly dissolving into streams of text that flow toward the figure.
- **Right side**: A vast digital void — deep space black (#0A0A0A) filled with floating holographic interfaces, rotating 3D geometric shapes (icosahedrons, tesseracts), streams of source code in soft green (#00FF41), and distant nebula-like clouds of processed data in purple (#7B2FBE) and teal (#00CED1).
- **Ground**: The figure stands on a reflective surface that transitions from aged wooden library floor on the left to a mirror-black digital plane on the right. The reflection shows the figure more clearly than the figure itself.
- **Background atmosphere**: Subtle volumetric light rays crossing the scene diagonally from upper left.

## Composition & Camera

- MUST follow the rule of thirds with the figure positioned at the left third intersection
- Shot as if captured with a Hasselblad X2D 100C, 90mm lens, f/2.8
- Shallow depth of field — the figure is sharp, the library and void softly blurred
- Neutral diffuse lighting from above with warm accent light (#FFE4B5) from the library side and cool accent light (#4169E1) from the digital side
- The overall image should feel like a Pulitzer Prize-winning conceptual photograph reimagined as digital art

## Artistic Style

- Blend of classical Renaissance portraiture composition with cutting-edge digital art
- Inspired by the visual aesthetics of Blade Runner 2049 cinematography meets Remedios Varo surrealism
- Color palette: predominantly deep blues (#1B1F3B, #2E4057), warm ambers (#D4A574, #F5A623), with accents of electric teal (#00CED1) and soft gold (#FFD700)
- Texture: mix of oil painting brushstroke texture in the library area and perfectly smooth digital rendering in the void area
- The transition zone where library meets void MUST have a dreamlike quality with elements dissolving and reforming

## Mood & Atmosphere

- Contemplative, serene, intellectually vibrant
- The feeling of standing at the exact boundary between accumulated human knowledge and infinite computational possibility
- NOT cold or threatening — MUST feel warm, approachable, and deeply thoughtful
- Subtle sense of motion: the text streams flow, the geometric shapes slowly rotate, the light gently pulses

## Text Elements

- Small, legible text fragments visible on the figure's body should include recognizable snippets: a line of Python code, a haiku in Japanese, a mathematical formula (Euler's identity: e^(iπ) + 1 = 0), a fragment of Ukrainian poetry
- A single word floats prominently near the figure's raised hand: "Think" — rendered in clean sans-serif typography, softly glowing

## Technical Specifications

- Aspect ratio: 3:4 (portrait orientation)
- MUST be photorealistic lighting on a surrealist concept
- Maximum detail and resolution
- No watermarks, no artifacts, no text errors
