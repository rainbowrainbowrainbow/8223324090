Run the RPG adventure with `python3 surprise.py`.
The game now takes place in a whimsical Cat World. Every weapon and piece of
armor follows the feline theme and even changes the hero's appearance in the
ASCII scene. The HUD reports wounds if health drops too low and critical hits
can occur for both sides.

During battles, actions animate with short sounds and light effects. On each
level up you select from a stable list of active or passive skills. Check the
glossary from the main menu to read about items, skills and monsters.
